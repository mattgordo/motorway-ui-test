# Motorway UI Test

This hopefully showcases a variety of different techniques across JS, React and (S)CSS.

I went for a card layout (originally was going to do some Trumps but realised the data was not as useful as I had hoped) so went for this grid layout. Cards have some CSS animation and cards open a modal to view full image.

I also created a very primitive themes solution using SCSS variables to allow for better reusability across the components.

I developed this using Chrome 87

## Missing Features

- Unit Tests (I noticed the defacto one was failing as well)
- Didn't use 3rd party validation for form but created bespoke validation (on top of the standard native validation that comes with date for example)
